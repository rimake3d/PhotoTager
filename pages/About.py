st.markdown("""[***OpenAI GPT-4 Vision***](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) represents a cutting-edge multimodal model developed by OpenAI, capable of processing text and images in tandem. This allows for an array of functionalities, including the generation of textual descriptions from images, answering queries related to visual content, and creating images from text descriptions. Its excellence in general image understanding positions it as the premier choice for crafting titles and descriptions for stock photography.

To achieve optimal results, a solid understanding of prompt engineering is traditionally required. However, our platform emphasizes ease of use, eliminating the need for specialized knowledge in prompt crafting. We are dedicated to equipping our users with an intuitive interface that streamlines the process to straightforward outcomes. A Basic Interface has been established to facilitate your initial steps.

***Considerations***:

Access to this service is not complimentary. It necessitates an OpenAI Plus account, alongside payment for API calls (the cost per title generated is provided).
The model's performance, while advanced, is not flawless. Users should be prepared for occasional inaccuracies and verify the generated results.
While GPT-4 Vision augments creative processes, it does not supplant human creativity; it serves as an auxiliary tool.
This technology does not obviate the need for thorough keywording. Users must review and enhance the provided keywords as necessary.""")
